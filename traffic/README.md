- 🌐 Multi-modal transport graph (drive, walk, bike)
- 🔮 ML-based congestion prediction
- ⏱️ Adaptive A* route finding with traffic-aware heuristics
- 🌍 Interactive map visualizations using Folium
- ♻️ CO₂ and energy impact calculations
- ⚡ Parallel execution & optimized performance

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- OSMnx + NetworkX
- Scikit-learn (Gradient Boosting)
- Folium + HeatMap + MarkerCluster
- TomTom Traffic API
- Joblib, dotenv, haversine
